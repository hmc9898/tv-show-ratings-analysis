# TV Show Ratings Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of movies and television shows to examine the relationship between user votes and ratings. The focus is on TV content released during the so-called “Golden Age of Television” (starting around 1999), with the goal of identifying whether highly rated shows also tend to receive the most user engagement.

## Objectives

- Evaluate and clean a raw dataset with limited quality metadata  
- Focus the analysis on TV shows, excluding movies  
- Investigate how vote count influences rating score  
- Explore trends in content popularity over time

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach

- Explored the dataset to assess data quality and consistency  
- Removed missing and irrelevant entries and filtered for TV-only content  
- Visualized rating distributions and vote counts by release year  
- Investigated correlation and outlier behavior

## Key Insights

- Many of the highest-rated shows had relatively modest vote counts  
- Popularity and rating were not always strongly aligned  
- Certain years and genres consistently drew more user engagement
